Reimplementation of some of the scenes in "Calculated Movements" by Larry Cuba, 1982-1985
----

A video-recording of the original is available here:

The original animation was implemented using the ZGRASS programming language on a Datamax UV1 computer.

This reimplementation in Python with Processing was written by Felipe CorrÃªa da Silva Sanches <juca@members.fsf.org> and is released to the public domain.

For now, we're using the original audio and only reimplementing the visuals.
Later we could perhaps use SuperCollider or something similar to also reimplement the music and sound effects.
